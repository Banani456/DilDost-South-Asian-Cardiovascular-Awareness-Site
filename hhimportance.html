      <h2>Why is South Asian Cardiovascular Health so Important?</h2>
      <h3>
        Medical Racism and The Cardiovascular Health of South Asian Americans
      </h3>
      <p>
        &emsp;‘Masaledaar’ in Hindi translates to ‘full of masala’ or
        ‘flavorful’ often in reference to food. Unfortunately, this innate
        cultural additive is often dubbed the poison of the South Asian diet and
        blamed for various cardiovascular diseases in the community. However,
        doctors have only been feeding us half-truths. 10 years ago, a study
        ironically dubbed MASALA was launched in efforts to study long-term
        heart health in SA Americans, and the findings have been kept
        distastefully quiet. A handful of genetic deviations, cultural,
        socioeconomic factors, and a dash of insulin resistance paired with an
        array of other reasons make a South Asian body more susceptible to
        cardiovascular diseases. All of these incrementing factors make an
        overwhelming difference in how they should receive cardiovascular care.
        A caucasian-centric recipe for disease treatment has been ingrained in
        South Asians for decades and this ineffective one-size-fits-all approach
        to diverse bodies has jeopardized and taken the lives of many. By
        examining the history and context of medical racism, its impact on South
        Asian cardiovascular health, and current inclusive approaches, systemic
        biases within the healthcare system must be addressed to ensure
        equitable access to care and improve health outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;To grasp the exclusion in cardiovascular treatment, it's essential
        to contextualize the historical racism and medical bias against South
        Asian Americans. Between 1897 and 1924, the first group of SA farmers
        arrived in the United States. Unfortunately, SAs were “treated as
        undesirable immigrants … labeled enslaved, effeminate, caste-ridden and
        degraded.” (Bhandari 4). After anti-Asian riots and laws like the
        Asiatic Barred Zone Act (1917) and Oriental Exclusion Act (1924), the
        sparse uneducated farmers were left isolated as the only South Asian
        population in the US. Consequently, they couldn’t fight for their
        rights, let alone establish a medical plan personalized to their body.
        Basic survival needs had to be met first. Such treatment reflects
        lessons in both Bell Hooks “The Oppositional Gaze” and Carol Vance’s
        “Social Construction Theory”. In “The Oppositional Gaze”, a
        discriminative gaze brews fear when defining one’s identity and South
        Asians were very afraid of speaking up for their rights in such
        tumultuous times. On the other hand, Vance explains that one's sexuality
        is reliant on conformity to societal culture or lack thereof which led
        to gay and lesbian identities being dismissed as they were not seen as
        pre-existing but as social constructs. Denial of participation in
        studies for years is dismissive of the physiological differences between
        SA bodies and caucasian bodies as a social construction. Medical racism
        against South Asians and their cardiovascular needs began here.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;When travel bans were lifted in the 1960s, three waves of South
        Asians entered the states. The first wave comprised highly educated
        individuals, as South Asia's caste system restricted migration based on
        caste. While problems of discrimination still prevailed, this change in
        social class altered the national perception of SAs. These migrants
        painted South Asians as the ‘model minority’- a historic exclusion of
        SAs stemming from being perceived as being socioeconomically strong and
        consequently assumed to be well-off in all aspects. “Traditionally,
        research efforts to address health inequities only extend to those
        minority groups defined as underserved [leaving] most Asian and Asian
        American populations … entirely excluded.” (Shen 2021). Such exclusive
        practices are a perfect example of race being a social construct as seen
        in Dorothy Robert’s “The Invention of Race”. The model minority myth is
        a reflection of stereotypes constructed by race while simultaneously
        taking away access to healthcare for South Asians. Such assumptions led
        to most researchers never adapting their studies for SA bodies. While
        South Asians may hold high-paying jobs, this does not mean the minority
        should be considered less deserving when it comes to healthcares
        catering to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;The second wave began in the 1980s “continued to be dominated by
        students and working professionals but also included large numbers of
        immigrants who were family members of those who had entered the United
        States in the 1960s and 1970s” (Bhandari 7). This population was
        affected most by the colonial famines and “it was reported that coronary
        heart disease mortality was expected to increase approximately 29
        percent in women and 48 percent in men in developed countries between
        1990 and 2020” (Krishnan 2019). With the coming of the third wave of
        migrants in the post-2000’s who meet the latter statistics, this urgent
        need was met with the birth of the MASALA study through Alka Kanaya and
        Namratha Kandula. Their work is an example of the rebellious gaze of
        defiance discussed in Hooks text. Such phenomena align with B.A.
        Davenport's "Witnessing and the Medical Gaze," where medical
        professionals are cautioned against fixating on patients' socioeconomic
        status, race, or gender. However, the need to adapt studies to different
        bodies to save lives is equally as important and the lessons in this
        text should be taken as advice to save every patient by adapting to
        their needs instead of giving biased and unhelpful medical treatment due
        to a patients’ background. Until the SA population was strong enough to
        sustain itself, the healthcare system in the United States turned a
        blind eye investigating the South Asian cardiovascular public health
        crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;MASALA’s first research subjects were composed of post-1965
        immigrants with bodies largely differing from the first migrants. Still
        reeling from colonialism famines, “South Asians have a tendency to
        generate and store fat and not burn it off, amassing low lean muscle
        mass … because South Asians are “starvation-adapted”, due to having to
        survive at least 31 famines” (Bakar 2022). Research at Brown University
        shows that one famine survivor doubles the risk of diabetes and obesity
        in the next generation and raises cardiovascular disease risk 2.7 times
        for the following two. Not accounting for these variables leads to
        issues like heart disease calculators failing to accurately compute the
        risk for SA patients, jeopardizing their treatment and recovery (AHA
        2021). The post-1965 immigrants meet these unfortunate statistics, which
        MASALA accounts for in their research. South Asians also have various
        cultural reasons to receive personalized target care for heart diseases.
        A traditional SA diet is associated with deteriorating cardiovascular
        health. Various “traditional snacks, sweets, and entrees are rich in
        refined carbohydrates, are fried, and contain a high content of
        saturated fat.” (Shah et. al.) with even cooking methods reducing
        nutritional value of meals. Additionally, tobacco - a known contributor
        to cardiovascular diseases - and traditional forms like ‘paan’ (betel
        leaves) are often not accounted for in their consumption. When
        implementing change, it is easier to begin at a familiar level. For
        example, advising a religiously synonymous vegetarian diet, that holds
        lower resistance to insulin and lower high-density lipoprotein
        cholesterol, is a much healthier alternative than a western based diet.
        Furthermore, “dietary choices (Mediterranean diet or a diet high in
        fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes) and social connectedness' ' (Shah
        et. al. 2022) are associated with improved cardiovascular health. Shah’s
        research also created a clear general guideline for a South Asian
        patient as illustrated below - creating a clear path to dietary recovery
        that accounts for social determinants and culture of the SA community.

        &emsp;Culturally in tune, group exercise is more effective for South
        Asians contrasting with the traditional lack of emphasis on exercise in
        SA lifestyles. The pursuit of newfound methods for recovery for South
        Asian parallels with the journey of cancer perception, treatment and
        prevention in the context of race in Keith Wailoo’s “White Plague: How
        Cancer Crossed the Color Line”. As research broadened beyond its focus
        on upper-class white women, solutions for diverse bodies emerged,
        mirroring current efforts tailored to SAs.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;MASALA’s research is revolutionizing healthcare for South Asians
        but the American Healthcare system must support it. A new development
        extending to the future is Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal’s new
        legislature seeking funding for South Asian heart health promotion and
        ASCVD research. In light of this, medical racism cannot continue to
        diagnose different bodies with a narrow-minded approach. The medical
        community must fund, incentivize and prioritize medical research that
        centers diverse bodies particularly long excluded SA bodies. It is high
        time to start saving South Asians lives and keeping the community's
        heart pumping.
